## Comments

-   It's been a long time since I worked with Vue and Vite and creating a PWA with SSR has been a good challenge. Great experience and learning

-   Unfortunately, I was not able to implement Vitest or Tailwind in the application. The first is due to lack of time and the second is because I prefer to use native CSS.
